# Task ID: 22
# Title: Mobile UI/UX Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement basic responsive design and mobile compatibility for MVP
# Details:
Focus on essential mobile compatibility for MVP release. Implement basic responsive components and touch-friendly interactions. Advanced mobile optimization features including offline functionality, advanced gestures, and performance optimization will be deferred to post-MVP phases.

# Test Strategy:
Test basic responsive layouts on various mobile devices and screen sizes, verify touch interactions work properly, and validate mobile compatibility across different browsers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Basic Responsive Component Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement fundamental responsive design for all UI components to ensure basic mobile compatibility and usability.
### Details:
Implement essential breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Ensure components scale appropriately and maintain basic functionality across different screen sizes. Focus on core responsive behavior rather than advanced optimizations.

## 2. Touch-Friendly Interaction Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Design and implement UI elements that are easily accessible and operable via touch input, minimizing accidental taps and improving user experience.
### Details:
Increase button sizes, provide adequate spacing between interactive elements, and ensure all controls are reachable with a thumb. Avoid small or closely packed touch targets.

## 3. Basic Mobile Navigation Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2
### Description: Implement simple mobile navigation patterns to ensure core functionality is accessible on mobile devices.
### Details:
Implement basic mobile-friendly navigation (e.g., simple hamburger menu or responsive navigation bar). Focus on essential navigation functionality rather than advanced mobile patterns.

## 7. Deferred: Advanced Performance Optimization [deferred]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Advanced mobile performance optimization features to be implemented in post-MVP phase.
### Details:
This includes image compression, lazy loading, advanced caching strategies, and network optimization. Will be implemented after MVP release.

## 8. Deferred: Offline Functionality Implementation [deferred]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Offline-first features and service worker implementation to be added in post-MVP phase.
### Details:
Implementation of service workers, offline caching, and offline-first functionality will be handled in future iterations after MVP release.

## 9. Deferred: Advanced Mobile Gestures [deferred]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Advanced mobile-specific gesture integration to be implemented in post-MVP phase.
### Details:
Advanced gestures like swipe, pinch, tap-and-hold will be implemented in future iterations. MVP will focus on basic touch interactions only.
