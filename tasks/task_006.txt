# Task ID: 6
# Title: Core UI Component Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build reusable UI components using TailwindCSS with mobile-first design
# Details:
Create essential components: Button, Input, Modal, Card, Loading, Toast, Navigation, Header, Footer. Implement responsive design patterns for mobile-first approach. Setup component variants and proper TypeScript interfaces. Include accessibility features and consistent styling system.

# Test Strategy:
Test components across different screen sizes, verify accessibility features, test component variants and props, ensure consistent styling and responsive behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up TailwindCSS and Project Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the project with TailwindCSS, configure the mobile-first responsive design system, and establish a consistent styling foundation for all UI components.
### Details:
Install TailwindCSS, configure breakpoints for mobile-first design, and set up a global style guide to ensure consistency across all components. Prepare the folder structure for scalable component development.

## 2. Develop Core UI Components with Variants and TypeScript Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement essential reusable UI components (Button, Input, Modal, Card, Loading, Toast, Navigation, Header, Footer) with support for variants and strong TypeScript interfaces.
### Details:
Each component should be built as a functional TypeScript component, supporting multiple variants (e.g., primary/secondary buttons), and exposing clear props interfaces for type safety and reusability.

## 3. Integrate Accessibility Features Across Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Ensure all UI components are accessible, including keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and screen reader support.
### Details:
Audit each component for accessibility compliance, add necessary ARIA roles, labels, and keyboard interactions, and document accessibility features for future reference.

## 4. Implement Mobile-First Responsive Patterns and UX [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Apply mobile-first responsive design patterns to all components, optimizing layouts and interactions for mobile devices and progressively enhancing for larger screens.
### Details:
Utilize TailwindCSS responsive utility classes and breakpoints to ensure components adapt seamlessly from mobile to desktop. Prioritize touch-friendly interactions and mobile UX best practices.

## 5. Establish Component Documentation and Usage Guidelines [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for each component, including usage examples, props, variants, accessibility notes, and responsive behavior.
### Details:
Document each component in a centralized system (e.g., Storybook or MDX files), providing clear guidance for developers on implementation, customization, and best practices.
