# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement External Team Data Succession System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to automatically transfer and link historical match data, statistics, and opponent records from external teams to newly registered teams upon official registration, with admin approval and rollback features.
# Details:
Design and implement a data succession workflow triggered when an external team completes official registration. Build a matching engine to associate external team records with the new team, using fuzzy matching on team names and metadata, and provide an admin interface for reviewing and approving matches. Upon approval, transfer all relevant match records, statistics, and opponent histories to the new team, ensuring data integrity and preventing duplication. Implement audit logging for all succession actions, including a rollback mechanism to revert changes if necessary. Integrate validation checks to prevent erroneous or duplicate data transfers. Ensure the system is extensible for future enhancements and complies with existing team and match management modules.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create test cases for various external team registration scenarios, including similar and ambiguous team names. 2. Verify that, upon admin approval, all historical match data, statistics, and opponent records are correctly transferred and linked to the new team without duplication. 3. Test the admin approval workflow, ensuring incorrect matches can be rejected and only approved matches trigger data transfer. 4. Validate the audit log records all actions and that the rollback feature restores the previous state accurately. 5. Perform data integrity checks post-succession to ensure no orphaned or duplicated records exist. 6. Conduct regression testing to confirm no impact on existing team and match management functionalities.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design External Team Data Matching Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a fuzzy matching algorithm to associate external team records with newly registered teams based on team names and metadata
### Details:
Develop a matching engine that uses fuzzy string matching algorithms to identify potential matches between external teams and newly registered teams. Implement scoring mechanisms based on team name similarity, player roster overlap, and historical metadata. Include configurable threshold settings for match confidence levels. The engine should generate match suggestions for admin review and handle edge cases like team name changes or mergers.

## 2. Build Admin Approval Interface for Team Data Succession [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Develop an interface for administrators to review, approve, or reject suggested matches between external and newly registered teams
### Details:
Create a responsive admin dashboard that displays potential team matches identified by the matching engine. Include detailed comparison views showing team metadata, match history, and player overlap. Implement approval workflows with options to approve, reject, or manually adjust matches. Design the interface to be mobile-optimized following the platform's responsive design principles. Ensure the interface respects the role-based permission system, limiting access to administrators with appropriate privileges.

## 3. Implement Data Transfer and Integration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Create the core system to transfer match records, statistics, and opponent histories from external teams to newly registered teams upon approval
### Details:
Develop a data migration service that transfers all relevant historical data from external team records to the newly registered team upon admin approval. Implement data transformation logic to ensure compatibility with the existing database schema. Create validation checks to prevent duplicate entries and maintain data integrity. Design the system to handle various data types including match results, player statistics, home stadium information, and opponent records. Ensure proper linking of transferred data with the new team's profile.

## 4. Develop Audit Logging and Rollback Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.3
### Description: Create comprehensive logging for all succession actions and implement a system to revert changes if necessary
### Details:
Implement detailed audit logging that records all data succession activities, including user actions, timestamps, and affected records. Design a rollback mechanism that can revert specific succession events without affecting other system data. Create snapshots of team data before succession to enable clean rollbacks. Develop an admin interface for viewing the audit log and initiating rollback procedures. Ensure the rollback system maintains referential integrity across all affected database tables.

## 5. Create Succession Workflow Integration with Existing Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.3, 26.4
### Description: Integrate the data succession system with existing team registration, match management, and member management modules
### Details:
Develop integration points between the new succession system and existing platform modules. Create event triggers that initiate the succession workflow upon completion of team registration. Implement notifications to alert administrators about pending succession approvals. Ensure the system respects existing role-based permissions and integrates with the member management system. Update the match system to properly display transferred match history. Optimize all interfaces for mobile devices following the platform's responsive design guidelines.
