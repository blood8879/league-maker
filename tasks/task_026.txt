# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement External Team Data Succession System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to automatically transfer and link historical match data, statistics, and opponent records from external teams to newly registered teams upon official registration, with admin approval and rollback features.
# Details:
Design and implement a data succession workflow triggered when an external team completes official registration. Build a matching engine to associate external team records with the new team, using fuzzy matching on team names and metadata, and provide an admin interface for reviewing and approving matches. Upon approval, transfer all relevant match records, statistics, and opponent histories to the new team, ensuring data integrity and preventing duplication. Implement audit logging for all succession actions, including a rollback mechanism to revert changes if necessary. Integrate validation checks to prevent erroneous or duplicate data transfers. Ensure the system is extensible for future enhancements and complies with existing team and match management modules.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create test cases for various external team registration scenarios, including similar and ambiguous team names. 2. Verify that, upon admin approval, all historical match data, statistics, and opponent records are correctly transferred and linked to the new team without duplication. 3. Test the admin approval workflow, ensuring incorrect matches can be rejected and only approved matches trigger data transfer. 4. Validate the audit log records all actions and that the rollback feature restores the previous state accurately. 5. Perform data integrity checks post-succession to ensure no orphaned or duplicated records exist. 6. Conduct regression testing to confirm no impact on existing team and match management functionalities.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Team Matching Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement an algorithm to match external teams with newly registered teams using fuzzy matching on team names, region, and contact information.
### Details:
The algorithm should leverage similarity metrics and metadata to suggest potential matches between external and registered teams, minimizing false positives and negatives.

## 2. Implement Data Succession Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Build the workflow to transfer historical match data, statistics, and player records from matched external teams to the newly registered teams.
### Details:
Ensure all relevant data types are included and mapped correctly, supporting extensibility for future data types.

## 3. Create Admin Approval Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1, 26.2
### Description: Develop an interface and process for administrators to review, approve, or reject proposed team matches and data succession actions.
### Details:
Admins should be able to view suggested matches, inspect data to be transferred, and approve or deny each succession request.

## 4. Integrate Data Integrity Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Implement validation checks to prevent erroneous or duplicate data transfers during the succession process.
### Details:
Checks should include duplicate detection, data consistency, and referential integrity across all transferred records.

## 5. Implement Audit Logging and Rollback Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.3, 26.4
### Description: Build a system to log all succession actions and provide a rollback feature to revert data transfers if necessary.
### Details:
Ensure every action is auditable and that rollbacks restore the system to its previous state without data loss.

## 6. Develop User Interface for Succession Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1, 26.2, 26.3, 26.5
### Description: Design and implement user interfaces for submitting succession requests, admin approvals, and viewing succession history.
### Details:
Interfaces should be intuitive for both admins and users, supporting all workflow steps and displaying relevant status and history.
