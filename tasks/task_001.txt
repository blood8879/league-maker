# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript, Supabase integration, and development environment setup
# Details:
Create Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript, install and configure Supabase client, setup TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, and Zustand. Configure environment variables for Supabase URL and anon key. Setup project structure with /components, /pages, /lib, /types directories. Initialize git repository and setup basic CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Next.js Project with TypeScript Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a new Next.js project using create-next-app with TypeScript enabled. Ensure the project is set up with the appropriate TypeScript configuration files.
### Details:

## 2. Set Up Supabase Client and Environment Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install the Supabase client library and configure environment variables for connecting to the Supabase backend.
### Details:
Install @supabase/supabase-js, create a supabase client utility, and add environment variables (e.g., SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) to .env.local. Test the connection.
