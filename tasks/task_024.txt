# Task ID: 24
# Title: Performance Optimization and Caching
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive performance optimization and caching strategies
# Details:
Implement client-side caching with SWR or React Query. Setup image optimization with Next.js Image component. Implement code splitting and lazy loading. Setup database query optimization. Implement CDN integration for static assets.

# Test Strategy:
Test loading performance across different network conditions, verify caching behavior, test image optimization, validate code splitting, and measure performance metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Client-Side Caching Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement browser caching strategies to store static resources (images, CSS, JavaScript) on the user's device, reducing server requests and improving load times for repeat visits.
### Details:
Configure cache-control headers and set appropriate expiration policies for static assets. Ensure that frequently used resources are cached efficiently to minimize redundant downloads.

## 2. Image and Asset Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize images and other static assets to reduce file sizes without compromising quality, ensuring faster page loads and improved performance.
### Details:
Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim for image compression, and minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files to remove unnecessary characters and whitespace.

## 3. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement code splitting and lazy loading techniques to load only the necessary code and assets when required, reducing initial load times and improving perceived performance.
### Details:
Utilize modern JavaScript frameworks' built-in code splitting features and defer loading of non-critical resources until they are needed by the user.

## 4. Database Query Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and optimize database queries to reduce latency and improve backend response times, ensuring efficient data retrieval for dynamic content.
### Details:
Review query execution plans, add appropriate indexes, and refactor inefficient queries to minimize database load and speed up data access.

## 5. CDN Integration and Static Asset Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute static assets globally, reducing latency and improving load times for users regardless of their geographic location.
### Details:
Configure CDN caching rules, manage asset versioning, and ensure that static files are served from edge locations closest to the user.
