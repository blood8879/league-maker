# Task ID: 27
# Title: QR Code Integration System for External Teams and Mercenaries
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive QR code-based authentication system that allows external teams and mercenaries to integrate their historical records when joining the platform as registered users.
# Details:
Create a multi-component integration system with the following key implementations:

1. **Matching Code Generation Service**: Develop a unique code generator that creates cryptographically secure matching codes for external teams and mercenaries. Implement QR code generation using libraries like qrcode.js, storing codes in a secure mapping table with expiration timestamps.

2. **Integration Request Interface**: Build a user-friendly form where new registrants can input matching codes or scan QR codes. Create validation logic to verify code authenticity and check expiration status. Implement real-time feedback for code validation.

3. **Bidirectional Authentication System**: Develop a two-step approval process where the original team administrator must approve the integration request. Create notification system to alert administrators of pending integration requests. Implement secure token-based authentication for the approval process.

4. **Data Integration Engine**: Build comprehensive data migration logic that safely transfers match records, statistics, attendance data, and performance metrics from external/mercenary profiles to registered user accounts. Implement conflict resolution algorithms for overlapping data periods.

5. **Audit and Rollback System**: Create detailed logging for all integration operations including timestamps, data transferred, and approval chains. Implement rollback functionality that can safely reverse integrations if issues are discovered. Store backup snapshots before each integration.

6. **Data Integrity Verification**: Develop validation checks to ensure statistical consistency after integration (total goals, match counts, etc.). Implement automated conflict detection for impossible scenarios (same player in multiple matches simultaneously). Create data reconciliation reports for administrators.

Technical considerations: Use database transactions for atomic operations, implement rate limiting for integration requests, create secure API endpoints with proper authentication, and ensure GDPR compliance for data transfers.

# Test Strategy:
Verify QR code generation produces valid, scannable codes that correctly link to matching records. Test the complete integration workflow from code generation through final data merge, ensuring all historical records transfer accurately. Validate the bidirectional authentication by testing approval/rejection scenarios and confirming proper notification delivery. Test data integrity by creating scenarios with conflicting records and verifying resolution mechanisms work correctly. Verify rollback functionality by performing integrations and successfully reversing them without data loss. Test edge cases including expired codes, duplicate integration attempts, and concurrent approval requests. Perform load testing on the integration system with multiple simultaneous requests. Validate audit logs capture all required information and can be used for compliance reporting.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Secure Matching Code and QR Generation Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a backend service that generates cryptographically secure matching codes for external teams and mercenaries, encodes them as QR codes, and stores them in a secure mapping table with expiration timestamps.
### Details:
Use established cryptographic libraries to generate unique codes. Integrate a QR code generation library (e.g., qrcode.js) to create scannable codes. Store each code with metadata (team/mercenary ID, expiration, usage status) in the database. Ensure codes are single-use and expire after a configurable period.

## 2. Build Integration Request Interface with Real-Time Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Create a responsive web/mobile interface for new registrants to input or scan matching codes, with real-time validation and user feedback on code authenticity and expiration.
### Details:
Design a user-friendly form supporting both manual code entry and QR scanning. Implement frontend logic to validate code format and backend API to check code validity and expiration. Provide immediate feedback (success, invalid, expired) and guide users through the next steps.

## 3. Implement Bidirectional Authentication and Approval Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2
### Description: Develop a two-step authentication process where original team administrators approve integration requests, including notification and secure token-based approval mechanisms.
### Details:
Set up a notification system to alert team admins of pending requests. Build an approval interface for admins, secured with token-based authentication. Ensure only authorized admins can approve or reject requests, and log all actions for auditability.

## 4. Design and Implement Data Integration and Conflict Resolution Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.3
### Description: Create backend logic to migrate historical match records, statistics, attendance, and performance data from external profiles to registered user accounts, with algorithms to resolve data conflicts.
### Details:
Map external data structures to platform schemas. Implement transactional data migration with rollback on failure. Develop conflict resolution rules for overlapping periods (e.g., duplicate matches, attendance). Ensure atomicity and data integrity throughout the process.

## 5. Establish Audit Logging, Rollback, and Data Integrity Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive logging for all integration operations, enable rollback to pre-integration state, and develop automated checks for post-integration data integrity and reconciliation.
### Details:
Log all integration actions with timestamps, user IDs, and approval chains. Store backup snapshots before each integration. Provide rollback functionality to restore previous state if issues arise. Run automated scripts to verify statistical consistency and detect anomalies (e.g., duplicate players in matches). Generate reconciliation reports for administrators.
